Hi, weâ€™re Charlie & Emily and in 2023 we made the decision to ditch our full time jobs and hit the road in our self converted campervan. 

Our love for travel goes way back to when we first met in 2015. Since then, every spare moment was a chance to hop on a plane and discover new places but after many short trips, we wanted something more. So, in 2020, we took an unpaid sabbatical from our jobs and set off on a six week adventure around Southeast Asia travelling through Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. When we returned, with the world on shutdown, our dreams of travelling more were put on hold. 
 
Like many, we found ourselves confined to our home, but it was during this time that our interest in van life began. Charlie had always been intrigued by the idea, and I (Emily), though initially hesitant, quickly became hooked after watching countless YouTube videos. Before we knew it, we were knee-deep in van conversion research, waiting for the chaos to blow over. 

We started saving up our money, and by April 2022 we had bought ourselves a van! For the next 8 months, alongside working full time, we spent any spare moment converting our van and by February 2023 we were off!

## Before You Begin
Before you start the installation process, here are a few things you'll need:

Reversing Camera Kit: Purchase a reversing camera kit that includes a camera, wiring, and a monitor interface compatible with your Citroen Relay's built-in screen.

## Basic Tools:
You'll need basic hand tools such as:
- Screwdrivers
- Wire strippers
- Pliers
- Drill.

### Don't forget!
The best tool, is your brain! ;)

Wire Connectors: Get a variety of wire connectors, including butt connectors and crimp connectors.

Wireless or Wired Camera: Decide whether you want a wireless or wired camera setup. Wired setups are typically more reliable but require running cables.

Multimeter: A multimeter will help you test electrical connections.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace
Ensure your Citroen Relay is parked in a safe, well-lit area. Disconnect the vehicle's battery to prevent any electrical accidents while working.

## Step 2: Locate Wiring and Connections
Refer to your Citroen Relay's user manual to find the wiring and connections you'll need for the installation. You'll typically need to access the reverse light wiring, power source, and ground connection.

## Step 3: Mount the Camera
Choose a suitable location for your reversing camera. The most common placement is above the rear license plate. Use the included hardware to securely mount the camera.

## Step 4: Route Camera Wiring
Carefully route the camera's wiring from the camera location to the interior of the vehicle. Avoid sharp edges and hot components that could damage the wires. Secure the wiring in place using cable clips.

## Step 5: Connect the Camera
Connect the camera wires to the wiring harness, following the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, this will involve connecting the power and ground wires, as well as the video cable.

## Step 6: Run Wires to the Monitor Interface
Route the camera wiring from the camera location to the monitor interface location. Be sure to hide the wiring as much as possible for a neat installation.

## Step 7: Install Monitor Interface
Follow the instructions provided with the monitor interface to connect it to your Citroen Relay's built-in screen. This may involve removing the dashboard panel to access the screen's connections.

## Step 8: Power Connection
Connect the monitor interface's power wire to a switched power source in your van. This ensures that the camera is only active when the vehicle is in reverse gear.

## Step 9: Ground Connection
Connect the ground wire from the monitor interface to a suitable grounding point on the vehicle's chassis.

## Step 10: Test the System
Reconnect the vehicle's battery and test the system. When you put the van in reverse, the camera feed should automatically display on the built-in screen.

## Step 11: Secure and Tidy Up
Secure all wiring and ensure it is well-organized and hidden from view. Reassemble any panels or components you removed during the installation.

## Step 12: Final Testing
Take your Citroen Relay for a test drive and practice using the reversing camera. Ensure that it provides a clear view of obstacles behind the vehicle and that it functions correctly.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed a reversing camera in your Citroen Relay and integrated it with the built-in screen. This enhancement will make parking and maneuvering your van much safer and more convenient. Always follow safety guidelines and consult a professional if you're unsure about any part of the installation process.

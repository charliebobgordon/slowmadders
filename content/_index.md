# Our vanlife travel and nomadic living blog
Weâ€™re Charlie and Emily. We made this spot to share our journey as slow nomads, whether we're driving in our van or exploring out of a backpack. Join us for vanlife tips and travel guides as we ski the snow, chase the sun, and just do life on our own terms.
